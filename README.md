## Objectives
Design an app that will;
1.	Reduce disorganization-the app will enable passengers to book for their seats and even enable them to choose a seat of their own preference.

3.	Reduce embezzlement of funds-by having the app, there will be no need to have conductors who collect the funds since you pay through the app.
4.	Improve quality of service-all the passengers will pay for their fare through the app which gives them the opportunity to pay equally.
5.	Ensure passengers welfare-the app will allow passengers to rate the services and give feedback, It will allow the review.
